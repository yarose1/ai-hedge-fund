"""Portfolio construction — blend analyst views into target weights.

This is the fund's portfolio manager: it takes every analyst's Signal and
produces one target weight per ticker. Pure arithmetic, no I/O — given the
same signals it always produces the same book.

v0 policy: conviction-weighted. Capital flows to tickers in proportion to
their blended conviction, scaled so the whole book deploys `gross_target`.
Known wart, accepted deliberately: the cross-sectional normalization ignores
*absolute* conviction — a lone weak view would receive the full gross target,
which the risk stage then clamps ("conviction requests, risk disposes"). A
min-conviction floor is the obvious knob once `evaluate()` can measure it.

    Per ticker, the conviction is a weighted mean over *voting* models:

        conviction_t = sum(w_m * value_mt) / sum(w_m)

    An abstained signal (metadata.abstained is True — LLM failure or
    insufficient data) is excluded from numerator AND denominator: "no
    opinion" must not masquerade as "opinion: neutral". A non-abstained 0.0
    (e.g. PEAD outside its window) is a real neutral vote and dilutes.

    With market_neutral, convictions are demeaned cross-sectionally before
    scaling — what a pod does with analyst rankings: long the names the desk
    likes most *relative to the others*, short the least liked, sleeve sums
    to zero dollars. Uniform convictions demean to a flat book.

    Cross-sectionally, weights are (demeaned) convictions normalized to the
    gross target: weight_t = conviction_t / sum(|convictions|) * gross_target.
    All-zero convictions produce an all-zero (flat) book.
